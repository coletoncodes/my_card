This is just a simple application that stores all of my contact information.

**You can preview the app [here](https://coletoncodes-mycard.web.app).**

 This will open up a browser version of the application.

# What I Learned

This project taught me the fundamentals of Flutter UI, and solidified my knowledge in [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/flutter).

**Some other skills I learned/used with this project:**
- How to create Stateless Widgets.
- What is hot reload and hot refresh.
- How to use Containers to lay out your UI.
- How to use Columns and Rows to position your UI elements.
- How to add custom fonts.
- How to add Material icons.
- How to style Text widgets.
- How to read and use Flutter Documentation.
- Creating a web build in Flutter.

### Features & Ideas For The Future

I would like to keep working on this idea and create some animation for the buttons. I might consider adding a quick introduction page, or a "Get A Copy of My Resume" button.
